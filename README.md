# Patanyumba website

In this project, i got the chance to build a web app. The UI looks like <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/25563385/PatashuleKE">this.</a>

Here's a <a href="https://raw.githack.com/imhilla/patanyumba/home-page/index.html">live link</a> of the front page.

Here is how the web app is structured:
The web page is divided into four main parts as below;

1. The main webpage

This page consists of the header and the footer. It has a background image with a clear description of the site. The user has a chance to know how everything works. Pata nyumba works in four ways. This leads to four steps and later other three pages. The user searches, locates, applies and waits for a reply.

Below it there are links to the other pages

2. Sign up page

The user if interested will have the opportunity to sign up before making an application. The sign up page has a form which must be filled.

3. Search page

In this page we allow the user to use dropdown menus to easily figure out which county, location and home she could get.

4. Homes page

This is the results page for every homes in the webpage. It has the name of the home found and its properties.
